# RPGProject
This is my code for an RPG Project. A lot of the core code is from GameDev.tv's Unity RPG Course, but I have heavily retrofitted the base and created new scripts to fit my needs. 

The number of commits does not reflect the effort put into this work. I had nearly two years of history before my first commit, only working in my free time while holding a full-time IT job.
