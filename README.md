# RPGProject
This is my code for an RPG Project. A lot of the core code is from GameDev.tv's Unity RPG Course, but I have heavily retrofitted the base and created new scripts to fit my needs. Link to the GameDev.tv repository can be found here: https://github.com/UnityRPGv2/RPG

The number of commits does not reflect the effort put into this work. I had nearly two years of history before my first commit, only working in my free time while holding a full-time IT job. I regret not committing to GitHub from the start because my commit history is not an accurate visual representation of my efforts.
